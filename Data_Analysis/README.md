# Data Analysis README

This directory is divided into the following sub-directories, each representing a specific part of our analysis: <br>
1 - '': <br>
2 - '': <br>
3 - '': <br>

The majority of analysis was performed using Python based Jupyter notebooks to process and visualize results. The directories are ordered in the order they should be run, with earlier results in the paper coming first.
